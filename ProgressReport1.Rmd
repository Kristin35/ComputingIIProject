## Goals 

The goal of this project is to create a tidy, accessible, database using Dr. Utt's ammonite fossil collection. It will be organized by name of specimen, image, date collected, and potentially age of fossil.  

## Progress

We successfully created a repository on GitHub. We all have joined the repository and have access to it through RStudio. We have created this Progress Report file.

##Resources Consulted
We have spoken with Dr. Utt about accessing the fossils for a period of time in order to collect infromation from them to put into our database.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Please ignore this, I am still testing this file.
