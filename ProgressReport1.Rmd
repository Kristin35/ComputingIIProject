```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Progress

We successfully created a repository on GitHub. We all have joined the repository and have access to it through RStudio. We have created this Progress Report file.

## Including Plots

I am still testing to see if it will work.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
