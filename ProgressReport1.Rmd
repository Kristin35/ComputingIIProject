## Goals 

The goal of this project is to create a tidy, accessible, database using Dr. Utt's ammonite fossil collection. It will be organized by name of specimen, image, date collected, and potentially age of fossil.  

## Progress

We successfully created a repository on GitHub. We all have joined the repository and have access to it through RStudio. We have created this Progress Report file.

##Resources Consulted
We have spoken with Dr. Utt about accessing the fossils for a period of time in order to collect information from them to put into our database.
